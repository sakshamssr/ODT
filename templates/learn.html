                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What defines a bond?</h2>
                    <p class="text-white-700">A bond is like a friendly loan between two parties: the buyer (bondholder) lends money to the issuer, which can be a government, corporation, or municipality in need of funds. When you invest in a government bond, you're essentially giving a helping hand to the government. Opt for a corporate bond, and you're supporting a company. Similar to a loan, bonds pay interest periodically and return the initial amount, known as the principal, at a set time – the maturity date.<br>Let's imagine a company wants to build a new $1 million plant. To fund this project, they decide to sell 1,000 bonds at $1,000 each. The face value, or 'price tag' of each bond is $1,000. The company, now the issuer, sets an annual interest rate, or coupon, and a time frame for repaying the principal – the $1 million. In our scenario, they might opt for a five-year bond with a 5% annual coupon. After five years, the bond matures, and the company returns the $1,000 face value to each bondholder.<br>
                        The time it takes for a bond to mature is vital, influencing the risk and potential return for investors. A five-year bond is generally considered less risky than a 30-year one, as more factors can impact a 30-year repayment. Longer-term bonds come with higher interest rates, potentially offering greater returns but at the expense of added risk.
                        Every bond involves a level of risk, like the chance that the issuer might fail to repay the loan in full, known as default. Credit rating services assess this risk, helping investors evaluate and set interest rates. A higher-rated issuer means a lower interest rate, but also potentially lower returns. On the flip side, bonds with lower credit ratings can offer higher returns but come with a higher risk of default.

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How is a bond's price determined in the market?</h2>
                    <p class="text-white-700">Once bonds are issued, they enter the "secondary market" for buying and selling. While some trade publicly, most transactions occur between large broker-dealers representing clients.<br>

                        The bond's price and yield dictate its value in this secondary market. Simply put, a bond must have a buying and selling price, and its yield is the actual yearly return if held until maturity. The chart showcases the impact of rising and falling interest rates on bond prices and yields.<br>
                        
                        Understanding bond prices involves quoting as a percentage of the bond's face value. Adding a zero to the market price clarifies its value. For example, a bond quoted at 99 translates to $990 for every $1,000 of face value, termed as trading at a discount. If quoted at 101, it costs $1,010, trading at a premium. A bond at 100 costs $1,000, trading at par. "Par value" simply means face value. Most bonds start below par and can fluctuate above or below par in the secondary market.<br>
                        
                        Rising interest rates tend to lower bond prices, while falling rates can raise them. On a short-term basis, rate changes can impact bond values, but over the long term, rising rates may enhance a bond portfolio's return.

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Measuring bond risk: What is duration?</h2>
                    <p class="text-white-700">Understanding the inverse relationship between price and yield in bonds is crucial. Another key aspect is measuring how much a bond's price reacts to interest rate shifts.<br>

                        Duration is the measure used for this. It's a weighted average of a bond's cash flows, including regular coupon payments and the significant payment at maturity. Duration, expressed in years, is usually less than the maturity period. Zero-coupon bonds, with no regular payments, have equal maturity and duration, making them attractive to those expecting rate declines.<br>
                        
                        Duration provides a risk measure, allowing comparison of bonds with different characteristics. It estimates the approximate price change for a 100-basis-point shift in interest rates. For instance, if rates fall by 1%, a two-year duration bond's price rises by 2%, while a five-year duration bond rises by 5%.<br>
                        
                        Portfolio duration is the weighted average of individual bond durations. This helps manage a portfolio's sensitivity to interest rate changes.<br>
                        
                        The role of bonds in a portfolio
                        Bonds have been a go-to investment for various reasons since the early 20th century. Investors value them for capital preservation, income, diversification, and as a hedge against economic downturns or deflation.</p>
